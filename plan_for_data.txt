seeds.rb should generatte a prototype object that can be used to create 
new instances of that object. Each instance of an object should have its own
prototype (sleeping ca vs awake catvs gone back to sleep cat.)

To pull a prototype of a given object, you should use 
new_item = Item.find_by_name("item_name").where(:proto == true).dup

then set the appropriate associations. 

new_item.inventory_id = new_inventory.id 

etc etc 

Then create siblings and children in the same way.
